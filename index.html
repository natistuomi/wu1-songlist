            <p>
                Half past twelve<br>
                And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone<br>
                How I hate to spend the evening on my own<br>
                Autumn winds<br>
                Blowing outside my window as I look around the room<br>
                And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
            </p>
            <p>
                There's not a soul out there<br>
                No one to hear my prayer
            </p>
            <p>
                Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight<br>
                Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away<br>
                Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight<br>
                Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
            </p>
            <p>
                Movie stars<br>
                Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win<br>
                It's so different from the world I'm living in<br>
                Tired of TV<br>
                I open the window and I gaze into the night<br>
                But there's nothing there to see no one in sight
            </p>
            <p>
                There's not a soul out there<br>

            </header>
            <p>
                I've been cheated by you since I don't know when<br>
                So I made up my mind, it must come to an end<br>
                Look at me now, will I ever learn<br>
                I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control<br>
                There's a fire within my soul
            </p>
            <p>
                and I can hear a bell ring<br>
                (One more look) and I forget everything, whoa
            </p>
            <p>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>
                Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
                My, my, just how much I've missed you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, now I really know<br>
                My, my, I could never let you go
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been angry and sad about things that you do<br>
                I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through<br>
                And when you go, when you slam the door<br>
                I think you know that you won't be away too long<br>
                You know that I'm not that strong
            </p>
            <p>
                and I can hear a bell ring<br>

                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, even if I say<br>
                Bye-bye, leave me now or never<br>
                Mamma mia, it's a game we play<br>
                Bye-bye doesn't mean forever
            </p>
            <p>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>

            <p>
                I was sick and tired of everything<br>
                When I called you last night from Glasgow<br>
                All I do is eat and sleep and sing<br>
                Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)<br>
                So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)<br>
                Suddenly I feel all right<br>
                (And suddenly it's gonna be)<br>
                And it's gonna be so different<br>
                When I'm on the stage tonight
            </p>
            <p>
                Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me<br>
                Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)<br>
                Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)<br>
                Feeling like a number one<br>

            <p>
                Facing twenty thousand of your friends<br>
                How can anyone be so lonely<br>
                Part of a success that never ends<br>
                Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)<br>
                There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)<br>
                But it's gonna be alright<br>
                (You'll soon be changing everything)<br>
                Everything will be so different<br>
                When I'm on the stage tonight

                Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find<br>
                I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind<br>
                Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood<br>
                It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

                Though I try, how can I carry on?
            </p>
            <p>
                You seemed so far away, though you were standing near<br>
                You made me feel alive but something died, I fear<br>
                I really tried to make it up, I wish I understood<br>
                What happened to our love, it used to be so good
            </p>
            <p>
                So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, S.O.S.<br>
                The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
            </p>

                Summer night city
            </p>
            <p>
                Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark<br>
                Summer night city<br>
                Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park<br>
                Summer night city
            </p>
            <p>
                In the sun, I feel like sleeping<br>
                I can't take it for too long<br>
                My impatience slowly creeping<br>
                Up my spine and growing strong<br>
                I know what's waiting there for me<br>
                Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free, ah-ah
            </p>
            <p>
                When the night comes with the action<br>
                I just know it's time to go<br>
                Can't resist the strange attraction<br>
                From that giant dynamo<br>
                Lots to take and lots to give<br>
                Time to breathe and time to live
            </p>
            <p>
                Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark<br>

                Summer night city
            </p>
            <p>
                It's elusive call it glitter<br>
                Somehow something turns me on<br>
                Some folks only see the litter<br>
                We don't miss them when they're gone<br>
                I love the feeling in the air<br>
                My kind of people everywhere, ah-ah
            </p>
            <p>
                When the night comes with the action<br>
                I just know it's time to go<br>
                Can't resist the strange attraction<br>
                From that giant dynamo<br>
                And tomorrow, when it's dawning<br>
                And the first birds start to sing<br>
                In the pale light of the morning<br>
                Nothing's worth remembering<br>
                It's a dream, it's out of reach<br>
                Scattered driftwood on a beach
            </p>
            <p>
                Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark<br>
                Summer night city<br>
                Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park<br>
                Summer night city

                I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay<br>
                Ain't it sad?<br>
                And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me<br>
                That's too bad<br>
                In my dreams I have a plan<br>
                If I got me a wealthy man<br>
                I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball
            </p>
            <p>

                A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind<br>
                Ain't it sad?<br>
                And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me<br>
                That's too bad<br>
                So I must leave, I'll have to go<br>
                To Las Vegas or Monaco<br>
                And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

            </header>
            <p>
                I don't wanna talk<br>
                About things we've gone through<br>
                Though it's hurting me<br>
                Now it's history
            </p>
            <p>
                I've played all my cards<br>
                And that's what you've done too<br>
                Nothing more to say<br>
                No more ace to play
            </p>
            <p>
                The winner takes it all<br>
                The loser's standing small<br>
                Beside the victory<br>
                That's her destiny
            </p>
            <p>
                I was in your arms<br>
                Thinking I belonged there<br>
                I figured it made sense<br>
                Building me a fence
            </p>
            <p>
                Building me a home<br>
                Thinking I'd be strong there<br>
                But I was a fool<br>
                Playing by the rules
            </p>
            <p>
                The gods may throw a dice<br>
                Their minds as cold as ice<br>
                And someone way down here<br>
                Loses someone dear
            </p>
            <p>
                The winner takes it all (takes it all)<br>
                The loser has to fall (has to fall)<br>
                It's simple and it's plain (it's so plain)<br>
                Why should I complain? (Why complain?)
            </p>
            <p>
                But tell me, does she kiss<br>
                Like I used to kiss you?<br>
                Does it feel the same<br>
                When she calls your name?
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere deep inside<br>
                You must know I miss you<br>
                But what can I say?<br>
                Rules must be obeyed
            </p>
            <p>
                The judges will decide (will decide)<br>
                The likes of me abide (me abide)<br>
                Spectators of the show (of the show)<br>
                Always staying low (staying low)
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is on again (on again)<br>
                A lover or a friend (or a friend)<br>
                A big thing or a small (big or small)<br>
                The winner takes it all (takes it all)
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't wanna talk<br>
                If it makes you feel sad<br>
                And I understand<br>
                You've come to shake my hand
            </p>
            <p>
                I apologize<br>
                If it makes you feel bad<br>
                Seeing me so tense<br>
                No self-confidence<br>
                But you see
            </p>
            <p>
                The winner takes it all<br>
                The winner takes it all
            </p>
            <p>
                So the winner takes it all<br>
                And the loser has to fall<br>
                Throw the dice, cold as ice<br>
                Way down here, someone dear<br>
                Takes it all, has to fall<br>
                And it's plain, why complain?

                You're enchained by your own sorrow<br>
                In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow<br>
                How I hate to see you like this<br>

                I'm a shoulder you can cry on<br>
                Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on<br>
                You were always sure of yourself<br>
                Now I see you've broken a feather<br>

                Chiquitita, you and I know<br>
                How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving<br>
                You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end<br>
                You will have no time for grieving<br>
                Chiquitita, you and I cry<br>

            <p>
                So the walls came tumbling down<br>
                And your love's a blown out candle<br>
                All is gone and it seems too hard to handle<br>

                They passed me by<br>
                All of those great romances<br>
                You were, I felt, robbing me<br>
                Of my rightful chances<br>
                My picture clear<br>
                Everything seemed so easy
            </p>
            <p>
                And so I dealt you the blow<br>
                One of us had to go<br>
                Now it's different, I want you to know

            <p>
                One of us is crying, one of us is lying<br>
                In a lonely bed<br>
                Staring at the ceiling<br>
                Wishing she was somewhere else instead<br>
                One of us is lonely, one of us is only<br>
                Waiting for a call<br>
                Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small<br>
                Wishing she had never left at all
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw myself<br>
                As a concealed attraction<br>
                I felt you kept me away<br>
                From the heat and the action<br>
                Just like a child<br>
                Stubborn and misconceiving
            </p>
            <p>
                That's how I started the show<br>
                One of us had to go<br>
                Now I'm changed and I want you to know
            </p>
            <p>
                One of us is crying, one of us is lying<br>
                In a lonely bed<br>
                Staring at the ceiling<br>
                Wishing she was somewhere else instead<br>
                One of us is lonely, one of us is only<br>
                Waiting for a call<br>
                Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small<br>
                Wishing she had never left at all
            </p>
            <p>
                Never left at all
            </p>
            <p>
                Staring at the ceiling<br>
                Wishing she was somewhere else instead
            </p>
            <p>
                One of us is lonely, one of us is only<br>
                Waiting for a call<br>
                Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small

            <p>
                No more carefree laughter<br>
                Silence ever after<br>
                Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes<br>
                Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing me, knowing you (ah-ha)<br>
                There is nothing we can do<br>
                Knowing me, knowing you (ah-ha)<br>
                We just have to face it, this time<br>
                (This time, this time) we're through (we're through)<br>
                This time we're through, we're really through<br>
                Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have (I have to go) to go<br>
                (This time I have to go, this time I know) knowing me, knowing you<br>
                It's the best I can do
            </p>
            <p>
                Memories (memories)<br>
                Good days (good days)<br>
                Bad days (bad days)<br>
                They'll be (they'll be)<br>
                With me (with me)<br>
                Always (always)<br>
                In these old familiar rooms, children would play<br>
                Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing me, knowing you (ah-ha)<br>
