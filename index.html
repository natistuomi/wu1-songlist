            <p>
                Half past twelve<br>
                And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone<br>
                How I hate to spend the evening on my own<br>
                Autumn winds<br>
                Blowing outside my window as I look around the room<br>
                And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
            </p>
            <p>
                There's not a soul out there<br>
                No one to hear my prayer
            </p>
            <p>
                Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight<br>
                Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away<br>
                Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight<br>
                Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
            </p>
            <p>
                Movie stars<br>
                Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win<br>
                It's so different from the world I'm living in<br>
                Tired of TV<br>
                I open the window and I gaze into the night<br>
                But there's nothing there to see no one in sight
            </p>
            <p>
                There's not a soul out there<br>

            </header>
            <p>
                I've been cheated by you since I don't know when<br>
                So I made up my mind, it must come to an end<br>
                Look at me now, will I ever learn<br>
                I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control<br>
                There's a fire within my soul
            </p>
            <p>
                and I can hear a bell ring<br>
                (One more look) and I forget everything, whoa
            </p>
            <p>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>
                Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
                My, my, just how much I've missed you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, now I really know<br>
                My, my, I could never let you go
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been angry and sad about things that you do<br>
                I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through<br>
                And when you go, when you slam the door<br>
                I think you know that you won't be away too long<br>
                You know that I'm not that strong
            </p>
            <p>
                and I can hear a bell ring<br>

                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, even if I say<br>
                Bye-bye, leave me now or never<br>
                Mamma mia, it's a game we play<br>
                Bye-bye doesn't mean forever
            </p>
            <p>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>

                Super trouper beams are gonna blind me<br>
                But I won't feel blue<br>
                Like I always do<br>

            </p>
            <p>
                I was sick and tired of everything<br>
                When I called you last night from Glasgow<br>
                All I do is eat and sleep and sing<br>
                Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)<br>
                So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)<br>
                Suddenly I feel all right<br>
                (And suddenly it's gonna be)<br>
                And it's gonna be so different<br>
                When I'm on the stage tonight
            </p>
            <p>
                Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me<br>
                Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)<br>
                Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)<br>
                Feeling like a number one<br>
                Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me<br>

                'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
            </p>
            <p>
                Facing twenty thousand of your friends<br>
                How can anyone be so lonely<br>
                Part of a success that never ends<br>
                Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)<br>
                There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)<br>
                But it's gonna be alright<br>
                (You'll soon be changing everything)<br>
                Everything will be so different<br>
                When I'm on the stage tonight
            </p>

                So I'll be there when you arrive<br>
                The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive<br>
                And when you take me in your arms<br>
                And hold me tight<br>

                Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find<br>
                I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind<br>
                Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood<br>
                It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
            </p>
            <p>
                So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, S.O.S.<br>
                The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you're gone<br>
                How can I even try to go on?<br>
                When you're gone<br>
                Though I try, how can I carry on?
